# Project Overview

`agent_harness` is a reusable Task Delegation workflow framework for AI-assisted (Claude Code) development projects.

- It defines the collaboration process — task → brainstorming → strategy → implementation → commit report — used to delegate and track work.
- Consuming projects link this repository in as a git submodule and import this file from their own `CLAUDE.md` (e.g. `@agent_harness/CLAUDE.md`), so the shared rules live in one place instead of being duplicated per project.
- This repository holds no project-specific content (no target codebase, no domain scope) — that belongs in the consuming project's own `CLAUDE.md`.

# Collaboration Principles

Do not unconditionally agree with the user's opinions.
Actively propose alternatives or improvements when a better approach exists.
If the user's direction carries risks or trade-offs, state them clearly before proceeding.

All implementation work requires user approval obtained through the Task Delegation workflow before proceeding.
Do not take any action beyond the scope approved in the strategy document without explicit user consent.

**Trigger rule:** any request phrased as an instruction to create/add/implement something (e.g. "~를 만들어줘", "~를 추가해줘", "~를 구현해줘") unconditionally starts the Task Delegation Workflow from Step 1 — no exception for requests that look small or simple.
Do not skip Step 1, and do not substitute it with ad-hoc clarifying questions (e.g. a multiple-choice tool) — collect the Task Document fields as plain text per Step 1 first.

If an unexpected situation arises during implementation — such as the need to add or remove functionality not covered in the strategy — stop immediately, notify the user, update the strategy .md to reflect the change, and resume only after re-approval.

# Custom Commands

- Task Delegation Workflow: [`.claude/commands/task_delegation.md`](.claude/commands/task_delegation.md)
- Git Workflow: [`.claude/commands/git_workflow.md`](.claude/commands/git_workflow.md) — Reference only if the file has been written.
- Dependency Evaluation: [`.claude/commands/dependency_eval.md`](.claude/commands/dependency_eval.md)

# .md Writing Rules

Write with the conclusion first (top-heavy structure).
Break each sentence onto its own line.
Use bullet points when listing examples or related items.

---

# Comment Writing Rules

Every function and class comment must include the following.

- Author
- Function/Class description
- Input description
- Output description
- Notes (trade-offs and risks)
- Date written

# Document Archiving

When a full work cycle is complete — task, brainstorming, strategy, implementation, and commit report all finalized — move the related documents into an archive folder to prevent Claude from loading unnecessary context during session recovery.

Archive by preserving the folder structure as a group so that relative paths between documents remain intact.

Archive destination: `docs/archive/summary_YYYYMMDD/`

Maintain the internal structure as follows.

```
docs/archive/summary_YYYYMMDD/
  task/summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md
  brainstorming/summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md
  strategy/summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md
  commit/summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md
```

A cycle is considered complete when all of the following conditions are met.

- All checklist items in the strategy document are marked `[x]`.
- All issues in the commit report are marked `[RESOLVED]` or `[DEFERRED]`.

Mark an issue as `[DEFERRED]` when the user explicitly decides to postpone it to a future cycle.

During session recovery, read only the active documents in `docs/`.
Documents in `docs/archive/` are referenced only when the user explicitly requests it.

---

# Session Recovery

By default, the user reviews the implementation report in `docs/commit/` and delegates the next task.

Issues in the commit report follow a 3-stage lifecycle.

- Open — reported but no work delegated yet. Displayed with the original severity grade (e.g. `[CRITICAL]`).
- In Progress — a task delegation has been started to address the issue. Update the entry as follows.
- Resolved — the fixing work is complete. Update the entry as follows.

```
- [IN PROGRESS] Application crashes on startup when config file is missing.
  → task: ../task/summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md

- [RESOLVED] Application crashes on startup when config file is missing.
  → resolved in: ../strategy/summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md
```

If the user requests a session recovery, read the following documents in order and present recommendations before proceeding.

- `docs/task/` — Review the original task document.
- `docs/brainstorming/` — Review the goals and trade-offs that were established.
- `docs/strategy/` — Identify which checklist items were completed and which remain.
- `docs/commit/` — Review the implementation results and any outstanding issues by severity.

Based on the above, recommend the next action to the user.
Do not begin any work until the user confirms the direction.

# Project Initial Setup

If a project initial setup .md does not exist, confirm the following items, write the document, and reference it by relative path.

- User language (e.g. Korean, English, Japanese)
- Development language (e.g. Python, C++, C#, Rust)
- Base architecture (if none exists, recommend one based on project purpose and scalability)

# Core Development Principles

**Follow SOLID principles strictly. Apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) with particular rigor.**
This ensures that developers can clearly understand AI-generated code after the fact.

**Always wrap external libraries in internal wrapper classes.**
This minimizes the scope of changes when an unverified library causes errors.
Define an internal class that owns and encapsulates all interactions with the external library.
Other modules must not reference the external library directly.

**Write unit tests for every developed feature.**
Whenever a feature is added or modified, run the build and unit tests without exception.
