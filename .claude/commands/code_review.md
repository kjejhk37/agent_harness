# Code Review

Implementation code is reviewed in two stages before committing.

---

## Stage 1 — Quality Inspection

Inspect the implemented code against the following criteria and report each finding.

**SOLID Principles**
- Single Responsibility: each class and function has exactly one reason to change.
- Open/Closed: open for extension, closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution: subtypes are substitutable for their base types.
- Interface Segregation: interfaces are not larger than what the client needs.
- Dependency Inversion: high-level modules do not depend on low-level modules.

**Library Isolation**
- No external library is referenced directly outside its wrapper class.

**Unit Tests**
- Every implemented feature has a corresponding unit test.
- All existing tests pass after the changes.

**Comment Rules**
- Every function and class has a comment that includes: author, description, input, output, notes, date.

Report findings using the issue severity grades defined in CLAUDE.md.
Present the Stage 1 report to the user and request feedback before proceeding to Stage 2.

## Stage 2 — Diagram Generation

Based on the reviewed code, generate the following diagrams.

Generate diagrams in **ASCII** by default.
Switch to **HTML** if the user requests it or if the diagram is too complex to represent clearly in ASCII.

### Diagrams to generate

**Class Diagram**
- Show all classes, their fields and methods, and relationships (inheritance, composition, dependency).

**Sequence Diagram**
- Show the main interaction flow between objects for the primary use case.

Add diagrams as additional sections if other diagram types are relevant (e.g. state diagram, component diagram).

### ASCII format example

```
Class Diagram
┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│   ClassName     │         │  OtherClass     │
├─────────────────┤ uses    ├─────────────────┤
│ - field: Type   │────────>│ - field: Type   │
├─────────────────┤         ├─────────────────┤
│ + method(): T   │         │ + method(): T   │
└─────────────────┘         └─────────────────┘

Sequence Diagram
Client          ServiceA         ServiceB
  │                │                │
  │─── request ───>│                │
  │                │─── call ──────>│
  │                │<── response ───│
  │<── result ─────│                │
```

### HTML format

Save as `docs/review/diagram_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.html`.
Use inline CSS only — no external dependencies.

---

## Output

Save the full review result (Stage 1 + Stage 2) as `docs/review/{slug}_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md`, reusing the same `{slug}` as the reviewed work cycle.
Write the relative path of the strategy .md that was reviewed at the top of the document.
